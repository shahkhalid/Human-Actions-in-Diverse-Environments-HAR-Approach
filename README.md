# Human-Actions-in-Diverse-Environments-HAR-Approach
 The proposed HADE architecture addresses the challenges in 3D action recognition through the integration of advanced models and a high-quality dataset. The documentation provides clear insights into each layer of the architecture, including data acquisition, preprocessing, algorithmic processing, and insights generation. This framework serves as a foundation for developing accurate and reliable 3D action recognition systems, with potential for broader applications in various real-world scenarios.

This approach consists of three main contributions:
1. Self-created HADE dataset (link is shared)
2. Trained CNN models with hyper-parameter tuned values
3. Visualizations and source code used for training and testing.
